		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>We know that voting can be overwhelming--even if you know what you're doing, but especially if you're newly registered. MyBallot, created by four Starter League students passionate about civic engagement, aims to assist first-time and inexperienced voters, but it's a great tool for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the booth on election day. Every visitor can enter a ZIP code to find out who will be on his or her ballot, including local and judicial races. Registered users can take notes and save their choices to create a custom voting guide. </p>

		<p>Debi is a former Girl Scout and an avid viewer of The Daily Show and Parks &amp; Recreation, and therefore takes civic responsibility really super seriously. She dressed up for Election Day this year like it was a national holiday (which it should be). She works as a graphic designer for a local trade publishing company and lives in Wicker Park. She's always on the lookout for interesting side projects, so say hello if you need a designer!</p></section>
